### Hi there, I'm [Alvaro](https://alvarocavalcante.github.io/) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a tech professional passionate about data! My career began as a full-stack software engineer, where I worked on developing web systems and cross-platform applications. However, my interest in the data field grew during my undergraduate studies, especially due to classes focused on artificial intelligence. 

Since 2018, I have been immersed in academic and professional projects related to data, from the undergraduate and the master's in computer science with a research focus on computational intelligence, to the positions of Machine Learning Engineer and Data Engineer which I had the opportunity to occupy since the beginning of 2021.

Outside of work, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects to support the community and have also shared my knowledge through classes and blog posts.
